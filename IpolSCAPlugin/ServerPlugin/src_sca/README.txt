# OVERVIEW

Given an image, the algorithm modifies the gradient vector field of the image  and finally it recovers the new image by solving the poisson equation using the Fast Fourier Transform as described in IPOL
     http://www.ipol.im/pub/algo/lmps_selective_contrast_adjustment/
The modification of the gradient is made in two ways:
1) Amplifying the gradient vector in the dark regions of the image. These dark regions are computed by threshold.
2) Applying a power function to the gradient in all the pixels of the image.

This program reads a PNG image, given T a threshold, and an amplification factor a and a power alpha, computes the new image. 
The program works on each color channel independently and on the gray intensity channel and then computes the color such that it preserves the hue.
# REQUIREMENTS

The code is written in ANSI C, and should compile on any system with
an ANSI C compiler.

The libpng header and libraries are required on the system for
compilation and execution. See http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

The fftw3 header and libraries are required on the system for
compilation and execution. See http://www.fftw.org/

# COMPILATION

Simply use the provided makefile, with the command `make`.
